# Sea-Vessels-Detector
Applied Machine Learning project of three NSU students (2nd year, 4th semester).
## Description
Automatic search for vessels making illegal maneuvers and mooring in wrong places (vessel in a certain zone).
### Main functions
1. detection of watercraft in the water area of port cities
2. Classification of found vessels
3. Detection and classification of offenses on video, if they are present in the frame.
### Trained models
### YOLOv8
A versatile framework for detecting and classifying objects in an image. It has high speed and accuracy, which is useful for video streaming from surveillance cameras.
### YOLOE
A model that has better optimization than the previous model and supports text-based detection by refining text embeddings.
### Main classes
1. Indastrial
2. Transport
3. Special
4. Yaht
5. Jet sky
6. Boat
